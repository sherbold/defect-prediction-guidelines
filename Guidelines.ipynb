    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this repository is to create shared and agreed upon best practices for defect prediction research. Suggestions for contributions can be made by anyone in the research community by creating and issue or submitting a pull request. These guidelines is to cover the following aspects to improve the way defects prediction experiments are conducted and the results are reported. The goal is that these guidelines will cover the following aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A taxonomy that defines the different defect prediction flavors.\n",
    "- How training and test data should be used for the different flavors of defect prediction.  \n",
    "- Requirements on the data needed to conduct studies including quality assurance for the data. \n",
    "- Performance criteria to be used for evaluations.\n",
    "- Statistical tests and visualizations.\n",
    "- Reporting of results.\n",
    "- Threats to validity that should be considered.\n",
    "- Replication kits.\n",
    "\n",
    "These guidelines are still a work-in-progress and not all aspects are covered yet. Once stable, we consider submitting the guidelines for review to a journal, e.g., Empirical Software Engineering and will invite everyone who significantly contributed (i.e., suggest content, helped to improve the guidelines) to co-author the manuscript. \n",

    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this section, we establish basic terminology, including often used synonyms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Term | Description | Notation |\n",
    "-------|-------------|----------|\n",
    "| Project | A software project that consists of well-defined scope, typically hosted in a single repository. |\n",
    "| Release | The release of a software project, e.g., version 1.0.0, version 2.1.1 | $S$, $\\mathcal{S}$ for a set of releases such that $S \\in \\mathcal{S}$ |\n",
    "| Version | Often used synonymously with the term release, although version is a bit more generic and can also refer to milestones or release candidates. | $S$, $\\mathcal{S}$ for a set of versions such that $S \\in \\mathcal{S}$ |\n",
    "| Artifact | The part of a software project to which defect prediction is applied. Typically a file or a class, but possibly also a commit, or even a part of a commit. | $s \\in S$ |\n",
    "| Defect / Bug / Fault | An imperfection or deficiency in a work product where it does not meet its requirements or specifications. Source: [ISTQB Glossary] | |\n",
    "| Pre-release Defect  | A defect that was found and fixed prior to a release. | |\n",
    "| Post-release Defect | A defect that was found and fixed after the software released. | |\n",
    "| Feature set / Metric set | A collection of measurements for software artifacts. |  $M$ |\n",
    "| Feature / Metric | A measurement of related to an artifact that is used as input for a classifier and the foundation for a prediction. | $m \\in M$ with $m(s)$ |\n",
    "| Feature space | A (usually) real-valued space that is defined by the measurements of artifacts according to the feature set. | $\\mathcal{M}$ |\n",
    "| Binary Label | The label assigned to artifacts depending on whether artifact is defective or not. | $\\{Defective, Clean\\}$, sometimes also $\\{True, False\\}$ or $\\{+1, -1\\}$, if this is relevant for the definition of a loss function |\n",
    "| Defect Count | An integer version of the label that assigns the number of defects as the label. |  |\n",
    "| Binary Classifier | A classifier that predicts if an artifact is defective or not. |  |\n",
    "| Scoring Classifier | A classifier that predicts a score for each artifact and can rank artifacts by their scores. |\n",
    "| Threshold | A fixed value used to transform the scores of a scoring classifier into binary labels, i.e., to make a scoring classifier into a binary classifier. All artifacts with values above the threshold are predicted as defective. |\n",
    "| Training Data | Data used as input for training a defect prediction model | Instances of software artifacts $X = (x_1, ..., x_n)$ with $x_i \\in \\mathcal{M}, i=1, ..., n$ and labels $Y = (y_1, ..., y_n)$. The labels are either binary labels or defect counts. |\n",
    "| Validation Data | Data used for comparing different candidate models, e.g., different hyper parameters. | $X'$, $Y'$ with the same structure as the training data. |\n",
    "| Test Data | Data used for the evaluation of a model, i.e., for final scoring. Must not be used for model selection, e.g., hyper parameter tuning or the selection of the best variant. | $X^*$, $Y^*$ same as training data |\n",
    "| Test Data (Heterogenuous) | Same as test data, but may be using a different feature space than training data. | |"

    "\n",
    "In last the two decades, defect prediction evolved into a broad field with many different variants of how experiments are conducted. Sometimes it becomes hard to distinguish between the variants - or even be aware of all of them. The goal of this section is specify fixed terminology for the different flavors of defect prediction in a taxonomy. \n",

    "  - Release-level Defect Prediction: the defect prediction model is applied to all artifacts within a release.\n",

    "      - Cross-Validation Experiments: the defect prediction model is trained on a subsample from the same release, usually conducted through $k$-fold cross-validation or bootstrap samples.\n",
    "      - Semi-Supervised Defect Prediction: the defect prediction model is trained on a subsample from the same release that was labeled with human intervention. \n",
    "      - Cross-Version Defect Prediction: the defect prediction model is trained on past release from the same project. \n",
    "    - Mixed-Project Defect Prediction: the defect prediction model is trained on a mixture of data from the same release and data from other projects.\n",
    "    - Cross-Project Defect Prediction: the defect prediction model is trained on data from other projects.\n",
    "      - Strict Cross-Project Defect Prediction: all data must be from other projects, data from prior releases of the same projects is not allowed.\n",
    "      - Mixed Cross-Project Defect Preidction: data from prior releases is used together with cross-project data.\n",
    "      - Heterogeneuous Defect Prediction: the training data is from different projects and has a different feature space than the test data.\n",
    "  - Just-in-time Defect Prediction: the defect prediction model is applied to changes with the goal to identify bug inducing changes, e.g., commits.\n",
    "    - Commit-level Just-in-time Defect Prediction: the predictions are for whole commits. \n",
    "    - Fine-grained Just-in-time Defect Prediction: the predictions are for individual file changes within a commit.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Release-level Defect Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Defect prediction is applied to all artifacts at a specific points in time during software development processes, e.g., to releases or release candidates. The goal of release level defect prediction is to guide the quality assurance efforts, i.e., focus testing efforts on the predicted artifacts. In the literature, the artifacts are typically modules, files, or classes, although methods were also already considered."
